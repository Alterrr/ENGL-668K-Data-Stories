**Due: Thursday, December 10 at 5pm.**

Your final exercise for the course is to use Google Sheets with the TAGS 
plug-in to collect data from Twitter and tell a short "data story" about 
the data you have collected. You will be working with a partner from a 
single shared data set; however, you will EACH BE SUBMITTING YOUR OWN 
INDIVIDUAL DATA STORY.

1. With your partner, decide on a data set to collect. You might choose a 
particular individual or Twitter account, or a hashtag, or phrase or term. 
Regardless, put some thought into what you want to collect, and if the 
data doesn't seem sufficiently "interesting" don't hesitate to try 
something else instead. In many ways, the decision of *what* to collect 
is the most important part of the assignment.

2. Explore the data using whatever spreadsheet functions you wish as 
well as the TAGS Explorer tool. What does the data seem to show? 
What are some possible explanations for what you see? Just as 
importantly, what *isn't* ascertainable from the data? In the space 
below, each member of the team should write their own data story, 
between 500-1000 words in length. Don't try to summarize *all* of the 
data. Just pick one thread and follow it through, telling us what might 
account for the conclusions you wish to draw and what the limits of 
those insights are. You may reference Pasquale or other readings if 
it seems helpful, but your focus should be on your data set, not 
responding to the readings.

3. Finally--and critically--please have whichever partner is running 
TAGS Share your spreadsheet with both Ed and me at these addresses: 
ehs@pobox.com, mkirschenbaum@gmail.com Writing your data story here 
(each of you) and sharing the sheet via Google completes the Exercise.

it in your data story if you want.

# Data Stories

## Ed Summers

For my data story I collected some [Twitter data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pFjo7Dot9GBaAbJ1LPAfgTnuBENZDOH1PGs9xDQfqYY/edit#gid=8743918&vpid=A2) for the poet [Patricia Lockwood](https://twitter.com/TriciaLockwood). I collected 1,592 of her tweets for the period from April 20, 2015 to November 22, 2015. To do this I configured TAGS settings to fetch using the API type `status/user_timeline` for the user TriciaLockwood. Lockwood has tweeted 12,658 times since May 2011, so I wasn't able to get all of her tweets because of the limitations of Twitter's API.

I thought it might be interesting to see who Lockwood corresponds with the most for the time period I was able to collect in, so I created a [pivot table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pFjo7Dot9GBaAbJ1LPAfgTnuBENZDOH1PGs9xDQfqYY/edit#gid=2056103132&vpid=A1) that listed the people she directed tweets at the most. The top 5 users she corresponded with were:

* [@cat_beltane](https://twitter.com/cat_beltane) - Gregory Erskine
* [@DVSblast](https://twitter.com/DVSblast) - [Dimitri Stathas](http://firstwefeast.com/eat/insomniacs-guide-manhattan-dvs/) (Rapper from New York)
* [@accomodatingly](https://twitter.com/accommodatingly) - [Stephen Burt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Burt) (Harvard Professor)
* [@PKhakpour](https://twitter.com/PKhakpour) - [Porochista Khakpour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porochista_Khakpour) (Iranian-American writer)
* [@McKelvie](https://twitter.com/McKelvie) - [Jamie McKelvie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_McKelvie) (British Cartoonist)

I thought it was interesting the the top person she corresponded with didn't seem to be easily googlable even though he had a somewhat distinctive name.  Erskine's profile says he lives in Louisville, Kentucky which isn't far from St Louis and Cincinnati, both of which are places Lockwood has lived in the past. According to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/magazine/the-smutty-metaphor-queen-of-lawrence-kansas.html) she seems to be currently living in Lawrence, Kansas. Perhaps they knew each other in the past and are keeping in touch via Twitter. I guess this is a somewhat creepy analysis. I'm going to stop now.
